    "## Number\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer is just a computing unit, so let's start with numbers, as it's *everywhere*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we focus on, **how python and javascript deal with numbers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, numbers were dealt as two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int` which is a signed integer with unlimited precision (well...not completely true though, as it is still being limited by your memory space to store every bit of your *grossly* large number)\n",
    "- `float` which is a finite precision, implemented as IEEE-754 double precision (64-bit) or `double` from C, ported towards cpython.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what the heck is it about 64-bit?\n",
    "\n",
    "*bit* is a smallest unit in our old-fashioned computing system so it's either 0 or 1, basically only two states.\n",
    "With 64bit-machine it means: 1 bit is used for the sign, 11 bits for exponent and 52 bits are for the fraction or significant. There you have it to store floats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taken this with the way our encoding works, we end up with 53 bits of binary precision for the float.\n",
    "What does it mean? It means that up to $2^{53}$, it could be converted to float without losing any precision.\n",
    "Or the biggest number, limited up to $2^{53}$, that can be represented correctly by both `float` and `int` types.\n",
    "There lies the limit of doing arithmetic with floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile in javascript, number has only a single representation as 64-bit, like python float, which is `Number`, in which `Number.isInteger(1.0) === Number.isInteger(1)`. To get `Number.isInteger()` returns false you need to add at least 2 decimals, such as this expression would return true, `Number.isInteger(1.52) === false`\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, it is only one type of number, i.e, `Number` in js, meaning it is simple and convenient. \n",
    "Unfortunately..., the precision is limited to 53 bits, i.e, $2^{53}$. Beyond that, it will come as a surprise as we will see later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The safe range integer, $x$, for javascript: $-2^{53} + 1 < x < 2^{53} - 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this basic repo does not touch on any kind of detail implementations of floating-point.\n",
    "But for your curiosity, please read further to Goldberg, 1991, *What every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough with the theory, here we go next to put our hands dirty, playing with number types and also a few of different literal types of numbers, and *last but not least*, a demo of rounding-error we should be **aware of** to avoid floating-number *errors* in both languages\n"
